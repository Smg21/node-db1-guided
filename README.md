# Introduction to Relational Databases, SQL and Knex

In this project we will cover the basics of `Structure Query Language (SQL)`, `Relational Databases`, and `Knex.js Queries`.

## Prerequisites

- [SQLite Studio Installed](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download).

## Project Setup

- [ ] clone this repository.
- [ ] move into the project folder.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.
- [ ] type `npm run server` to start the dev server.

## Coding Along

Before using the following scripts it's recommended to remove the database from SQLite Studio.

- [ ] type `npm run resetdb` to reset the database to its initial state.


The versions of project dependencies used in the recording are slightly different from the ones used in the starter and solution repositories, but this should not affect the relevant code of the Guided Project. In particular, you should use the #sqlite3 driver for Knex, instead of the #@vscode/sqlite3 one shown in the video.

The versions used in the repositories are more recent, and thus more similar to the versions you will install if you create a project from scratch.
